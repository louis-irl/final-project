            <h2>Ubuntu</h2>
            <p>
                Ubuntu is a free and open-source Linux distribution based on Debian.  Ubuntu is officially released in three editions: Desktop, Server, and Core for the internet of things devices and robots.  All the editions can run on the computer alone, or in a virtual machine.  Ubuntu is a popular operating system for cloud computing, with support for OpenStack.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ubuntu is released every six months, with long-term support (LTS) releases every two years.  The latest release is 19.10 ("Eoan Ermine"), and the most recent long-term support release is 18.04 LTS ("Bionic Beaver"), which is supported until 2023 under public support and until 2028 as a paid option.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ubuntu is developed by Canonical, and a community of other developers, under a meritocratic governance model.  Canonical provides security updates and support for each Ubuntu release, starting from the release date and until the release reaches its designated end-of-life (EOL) date.  Canonical generates revenue through the sale of premium services related to Ubuntu.
